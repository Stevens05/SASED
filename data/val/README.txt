This folder contains information on the sound samples that were used for each audio scene in the development set.

e.g.:
clearthroat115.wav
cough168.wav
pageturn081.wav

Each line corresponds to a .wav file from the training set, which occurs in the audio mixture for a particular recording in the development set.
This information can be used for example to carry out source-independent evaluations on the development set recordings.
