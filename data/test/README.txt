This README file documents the test dataset of the Synthetic Audio Sound Event Detection (SASED) task, including ground truth annotations.

--

Folder sound/ contains 54 audio files of 2min duration each. The format of the audio files is: raw PCM sampled at 44100 Hz, 16 bits (CD quality).

Folder annotation/ contains 54 .txt files, corresponding to the ground truth annotation for each respective audio recording. 
Each .txt file contains a list of detected sound events, specified by the onset, offset and the event class separated by a tab.
